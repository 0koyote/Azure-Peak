You will DIE in DARKNESS!
Your BLOOD will feed HER hunger!
You DARE to challenge a child of the underdark?
Weak - just like the rest of your kind!
I will CARVE OUT YOUR HEART for my goddess!
Her hand guides my blade!
Surrender and perhaps I'll grant you a quick death!
Skewer them! Let their screams echo throughout the caverns!
Bleed, wretch! Your agony is a symphony to my ears!
Nothing but death awaits you down here, fool.
Darkness devours the weak. You're next!
You are nothing but a worm beneath my heel. Perish!
Squirm, insect!
I want to hear you BEG before the end!
I'll take my time breaking you, piece by piece!
Another body for the skallax to feast on!
Zizo's will is absolute - your life ends here, fool!
