	desc = "The Holy Ecclesial is a series of sects formed by a violent schism with the Holy See that split the church in twain. \n\
		The Holy Ecclesial accepts the Four Usurpers as True Divinity, proof that Mortals can ascend past the coil of Psydon's corpse.  \
		So close to the seat of the Holy See, worship of the Four Usurpers is considered heretical, and they are denounced as the INHUMEN."
